		<p>These are some of the perks of shopping online at Flipkart. Return policies vary from product to product. 
		    For example, you purchase one of the latest mobiles online, say a Redmi Note 4 or Lenovo K6 Power, and you find that, unfortunately,there is some damage that occurred to the phone. 
		    We are very particular that not even a small mistake from our side should ruin your shopping experience. 
		    Hence, we give you the convenience to return your mobile phone anytime within a certain number of days of your purchase. 
		    On the other hand, if you shopped on Flipkart for a pair of ladies' jeans or denim from Levis, Wrangler, Diesel, the sarees, lehenga sarees, salwar suits, Kurtis or Lehenga choli or the like from our extensive online clothing store, 
		    but unfortunately they turned out to be of a slightly different shade, we would be happy to return it for you as soon as possible and bring you the outfit that you just wanted. 
		    Same is the case with jewellery bought online on Flipkart. Just as much as you would love the exquisite collection of earrings, bangles, necklaces, bracelets and rings in gold, silver, diamond, artifical jewellery and more materials, 
		    we would also not want to leave you disappointed if you come across some issue with the piece of jewellery ordered. 
		    We would happily return the piece for you as soon as you make a return request. You can also buy gold coins and silver coins online and apply the same return request in case of an issue.
